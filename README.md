# Gimbal-Lock-demo
Demonstrates the 'Gimbal Lock', a common problem that occurs in 3D rotations when using euler angles. The pitch is set at -90 degrees, this results in the alignment of the yaw and roll axes. On running the code you can see that change in the yaw or roll result results in a rotaion around the same axes. Hence, and axis of rotaion is lost.

You will need the matplotlib and numpy libraries to run the code given in GimbalLock.py
